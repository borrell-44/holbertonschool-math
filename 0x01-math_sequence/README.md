Project: 0x01. Math - Sequence



0. Write a function that returns the Heron sequence until having convergence with an error less or equal to .

1. Code the Fibonacci sequence until having a geometric behavior. How can we deduce the gold number ? 

2. We want the center of the image to be mapped to (0,0), so given a pixel we subtract half of the image height from the vertical coordinate, and half of the width from the horizontal coordinate. Next, the scale: we know that the Mandelbrot set lies within a circle of radius 2, so the entire width of the image should have length 4. 

3. We want the center of the image to be mapped to (0,0), the Julia set is the line segment between âˆ’2 and 2.
